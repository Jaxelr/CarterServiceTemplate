# How to contribute

These are the requirements which are pretty much global considerations for projects.

## Pull requests.

* Please dont use a master/main branch for PRs.
* Rebase relevant changes from upstream before PRs.
* If various commits are included, rebase them on a cohesive structure (separate features accordingly).

## Styles

Follow the .editorconfig guidelines and suggestions.
